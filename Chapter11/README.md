# Chapter 11: Integration with Metrics and Logs

In this chapter, we look at many integration points between these monitoring tools:
  * how metrics and logs can be enriched with request metadata,
  * how tracing instrumentation can be used to replace explicit metrics instrumentation,
  * and how logs and traces can be bidirectionally integrated with each other.
